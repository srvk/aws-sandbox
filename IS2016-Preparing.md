# Before running the VM

You need to do the following steps in order to be able to use the provided AMI.

- Sign up for an AWS account and create a [key-pair](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-1#KeyPairs:sort=keyName)
- Install the keys (for US East/ N. Virginia region) on your local machine, so that you can fire up an EC2 instance.
- If you have credits for AWS, apply those.
